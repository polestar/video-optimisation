## PDP Image sequence

!! Is this the right place for the introduction of the Image sequence with a link to the README file?

## Poster image

!! The description below could live on it's own README file

The poster image is used as the initial frame of a video to visually represent its content, attract viewers, and provide context before the video starts playing.

<u>Visual representation:</u> The poster image should visually represent the first frame of the video. 

<u>Resolution:</u> Ensure that the resolution of the poster image matches that of the video. Set the dimensions to match the width and height of the video.

<u>Format:</u> Save the image in the PNG format.

<u>Updating poster image:</u> If the video content changes over time please update the poster image to reflect the latest content accurately.

## Naming convention

!! Is this the right place for the introduction of the Naming convention with a link to the README file?
